# Predicting the Water Temperature of Toronto Beaches based on the Air Temperature

## Overview

This repo contains the code, raw, and cleaned data used in the creation of the 
paper 'Predicting the Water Temperature in Toronto Beaches'. The data used 
to conduct this analysis was obtained from the Open Data Toronto database 
through the opendatatoronto R package. The specific dataset which was used was 
'Toronto Beaches Observations', created by Toronto's department of Parks, 
Forestry and Recreation, found at 
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-beaches-observations/.
